# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

     How successful will Louiseâ€™s play Fever fundraiser be given short amount of time.  

### Purpose

     The purpose of this project is to estimate whether Louise's Fever fundraising be successful   
             given amount to time by analyzing different fundraisers data.  

## Analysis and Challenges
     
     The assignment was straight forward. I did not face any major challenges. The only major  
     challenge was that I'm new to Mac and had to learn many new functions to complete the 
     assignment. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

   1) The fundraisers that took place in Theatre in May had the highest success rate. 
   2) Overall the cancellation rate of the fundraisers that took place in Theatre was very minimal 
      over the year.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    
    The fundraiser amount between $45000-$49999 was a failure. The least riskiest value for 
    fundraising is less than $1000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

     We can include age. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
